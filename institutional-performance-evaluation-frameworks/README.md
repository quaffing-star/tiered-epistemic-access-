# Institutional Performance Evaluation Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the evaluation models, performance rubrics, and assessment tools used to measure how effectively institutions operate within the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Performance evaluation ensures that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and public engagement are implemented with consistency, quality, and accountability.

These frameworks support continuous improvement, institutional excellence, and long‑term ecosystem integrity.

## 🎯 Purpose

The institutional‑performance‑evaluation‑frameworks directory provides:

- performance evaluation rubrics  
- institutional audit frameworks  
- competency and role performance assessments  
- governance quality metrics  
- cross‑institution benchmarking tools  
- continuous improvement pathways  

These tools help institutions measure their effectiveness and identify areas for growth.
