# Ecosystem Principles & Axioms  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the foundational principles and axioms that guide the design, operation, governance, and long‑term evolution of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Principles and axioms serve as the ecosystem’s philosophical and structural backbone—ensuring coherence, stability, and alignment across governance, safety, provenance, certification, interoperability, and observability components.

These principles articulate the ecosystem’s commitments, constraints, and non‑negotiable design foundations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem principles and axioms provide:

- a unified conceptual foundation  
- shared commitments across institutions  
- design constraints for governance and safety  
- alignment anchors for ecosystem evolution  
- interpretive guidance for ambiguous scenarios  
- long‑term stability and coherence  

These principles help institutions reason about decisions, resolve conflicts, and maintain alignment across diverse roles and ecosystems.
