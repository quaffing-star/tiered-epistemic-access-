# Example Scenarios  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory contains detailed, narrative walkthroughs that illustrate how the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework operates in real situations.  
Each scenario shows how epistemic layers, licensing, certification, provenance, and downward‑migration interact during actual user–model exchanges.

These scenarios make the framework concrete, intuitive, and easy to visualize.

## 🎯 Purpose

The example‑scenarios directory provides:

- step‑by‑step narratives  
- layer‑specific reasoning examples  
- licensing and certification interactions  
- provenance and audit trail demonstrations  
- downward‑migration sequences  
- comparisons with unlayered AI behavior  

Each scenario is designed to be readable, realistic, and pedagogically useful.

## 🧩 Planned Scenario Categories

### **1. Scientific Inquiry Scenario**
A licensed researcher requests deeper‑layer reasoning for a complex scientific question.  
The scenario shows:

- licensing verification  
- certified model selection  
- layer‑bound reasoning  
- downward‑migration of sensitive insights  
- provenance logging  

### **2. Medical Consultation Scenario**
A clinician interacts with a certified medical model.  
The scenario demonstrates:

- layer‑appropriate diagnostic reasoning  
- provenance‑linked explanations  
- licensing checks  
- safe downward migration for patient‑facing summaries  

### **3. Educational Tutoring Scenario**
A student interacts with a layered tutor.  
The scenario shows:

- layer‑appropriate explanations  
- competency‑based progression  
- safe abstraction of advanced concepts  
- provenance‑linked learning pathways  

### **4. Software Engineering Scenario**
A developer requests debugging help.  
The scenario illustrates:

- layer‑bound reasoning for system internals  
- certified developer tools  
- provenance‑linked code reasoning  
- safe downward migration for junior developers  

### **5. Policy Analysis Scenario**
A civil servant interacts with a certified policy model.  
The scenario demonstrates:

- governance‑aligned reasoning  
- licensing checks  
- transparent provenance for public accountability  
- safe downward migration for public‑facing summaries  

### **6. Enterprise Workflow Scenario**
An employee interacts with an internal AI tool.  
The scenario shows:

- role‑based licensing  
- certified domain‑specific models  
- audit trails for compliance  
- safe abstraction for cross‑team communication
