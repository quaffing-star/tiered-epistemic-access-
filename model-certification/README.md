# Model Certification Framework

This folder contains materials related to the certification of AI models for safe operation within the Tiered Epistemic Access architecture. 
It outlines the requirements, evaluation criteria, and certification levels that determine whether a model is capable of:

- adversarially robust reasoning
- maintaining provenance integrity
- performing safe downward knowledge migration
- respecting epistemic layer boundaries
- demonstrating alignment stability under stress

Future documents in this folder will expand on certification tests, audit procedures, and institutional oversight models.
