# Governance Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory outlines governance structures, institutional roles, and oversight models that support the safe and scalable deployment of the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
While the concept note defines the architecture, the governance models describe *who* operates it, *how* authority is distributed, and *what* mechanisms ensure accountability.

---

## 🏛️ Purpose

The governance‑models directory provides:

- institutional blueprints  
- regulatory integration patterns  
- oversight structures  
- certification and licensing authority models  
- audit and provenance frameworks  
- hybrid governance pathways  

These models help translate the framework into real‑world institutional practice.

## 🧭 Governance Themes (Planned)

### **1. Hybrid Governance Model**
A combined approach where:

- **industry consortia** define standards  
- **government agencies** enforce compliance  
- **independent bodies** certify models and licensing curricula  

This mirrors aviation, medicine, and telecommunications.

### **2. Licensing Authorities**
Structures for:

- issuing human licenses  
- maintaining competency records  
- administering assessments  
- revoking or suspending access  
- coordinating with platform‑level enforcement  

### **3. Model Certification Bodies**
Institutions responsible for:

- certifying models for layer‑specific operation  
- evaluating robustness, provenance, and alignment  
- maintaining certification registries  
- auditing downward‑migration safety  

### **4. Audit & Oversight Mechanisms**
Models for:

- traceability  
- interpretability  
- provenance tracking  
- reasoning‑boundary enforcement  
- cross‑platform interoperability audits  

### **5. Standards‑Body Alignment**
Mapping the framework to:

- safety standards  
- provenance standards  
- transparency and auditability standards  
- international regulatory frameworks  

### **6. Platform‑Level Enforcement**
How platforms implement:

- layer access controls  
- licensing checks  
- certification gates  
- runtime monitoring  
- anomaly detection

## 📂 Future Documents

Planned additions may include:

- **governance‑overview.md**  
- **licensing-authority-model.md**  
- **model-certification-governance.md**  
- **audit-and-provenance-architecture.md**  
- **hybrid-governance-blueprint.md**  
- **standards-body-integration.md**  

These documents will expand the directory into a full governance reference set.
