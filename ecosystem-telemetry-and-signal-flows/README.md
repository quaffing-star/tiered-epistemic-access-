# Ecosystem Telemetry & Signal Flows  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the telemetry architecture and signal flow models that enable institutions to collect, route, interpret, and act upon signals generated across the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Telemetry and signal flows form the nervous system of the ecosystem, providing real-time insight into governance activity, safety behavior, provenance integrity, certification workflows, and interoperability performance.

This architecture ensures that signals are captured consistently, transmitted reliably, and interpreted meaningfully across institutions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The telemetry and signal flow architecture provides:

- standardized telemetry sources  
- unified signal formats  
- cross-layer signal routing models  
- event stream definitions  
- signal correlation and aggregation patterns  
- ecosystem-wide signal governance  

These tools help institutions understand system behavior, detect anomalies, and maintain ecosystem integrity.

## 🧩 Core Telemetry & Signal Flow Components

### **1. Telemetry Sources**
Defines where signals originate:

- governance events  
- safety constraint evaluations  
- provenance and attestation events  
- licensing workflow events  
- interoperability test results  
- public engagement signals  

### **2. Signal Types**
Defines categories of signals:

- events  
- metrics  
- logs  
- traces  
- state-change notifications  
- anomaly indicators  

### **3. Signal Flow Architecture**
Describes how signals move through the ecosystem:

- ingestion  
- normalization  
- enrichment  
- routing  
- aggregation  
- storage  
- visualization  

### **4. Cross-Layer Signal Correlation**
Defines how signals are linked:

- governance ↔ safety correlations  
- provenance ↔ licensing correlations  
- interoperability ↔ risk correlations  
- multi-institution signal stitching  

### **5. Telemetry Integration Patterns**
Reusable patterns for implementation:

- sidecar telemetry  
- embedded telemetry  
- external telemetry agents  
- federated telemetry models  
- multi-institution telemetry bridges  

### **6. Signal Governance**
Defines rules for:

- retention  
- access control  
- privacy and confidentiality  
- cross-institution sharing  
- auditability  
- versioning of signal schemas
