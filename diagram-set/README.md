# Diagram Set  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory contains visual diagrams, conceptual maps, and structural schematics that illustrate the architecture of the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These diagrams support clarity, communication, and standards‑ready documentation across research, governance, and implementation contexts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The diagram‑set directory provides:

- high‑level conceptual diagrams  
- epistemic layer maps  
- licensing and certification flows  
- downward‑migration schematics  
- provenance and audit architecture visuals  
- governance and institutional models  
- implementation pathway diagrams  

These visuals help stakeholders quickly understand the structure and logic of the framework.
