# Provenance Architecture  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the provenance, traceability, and auditability structures that support the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
Provenance is essential for ensuring that reasoning, data flows, and downward‑migration processes remain transparent, verifiable, and aligned with institutional governance.

The provenance architecture provides the mechanisms that allow licensing authorities, certification bodies, and platforms to understand *how* an output was produced, *which layer* it originated from, and *what transformations* occurred along the way.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The provenance‑architecture directory provides:

- reasoning trace models  
- layer‑transition logs  
- downward‑migration provenance structures  
- audit trail schemas  
- verification and attestation mechanisms  
- cross‑platform provenance interoperability models  

These components ensure that epistemic access is not only layered, but also **transparent, accountable, and inspectable**.

## 🧩 Core Provenance Components (Planned)

### **1. Layer‑Bound Reasoning Traces**
Documentation of:

- which epistemic layer generated an output  
- what reasoning steps were taken  
- what constraints or filters were applied  
- how the model adhered to layer‑specific discipline  

### **2. Downward Migration Provenance**
Structures for tracking:

- the original higher‑layer output  
- the distillation or generalization process  
- safety transformations  
- the final lower‑layer form  
- verification that no unsafe content leaked  

### **3. Data Provenance & Input Lineage**
Models for:

- tracking user inputs  
- identifying external data sources  
- verifying data integrity  
- preventing unverified or adversarial data from influencing deeper layers  

### **4. Audit Trail Architecture**
A standardized schema for:

- logging reasoning events  
- recording layer transitions  
- documenting licensing checks  
- capturing certification gates  
- enabling retrospective analysis  

### **5. Attestation & Verification**
Mechanisms for:

- cryptographic attestation of reasoning paths  
- verifying model certification status  
- confirming user licensing level  
- ensuring cross‑platform consistency  

### **6. Interoperability Standards**
Guidelines for:

- cross‑vendor provenance exchange  
- compatibility with existing provenance standards  
- integration with regulatory audit systems  
- harmonization across platforms and institutions

## 📂 Future Documents

Planned additions may include:

- **provenance-overview.md**  
- **reasoning-trace-schema.md**  
- **downward-migration-provenance.md**  
- **audit-trail-specification.md**  
- **attestation-and-verification-model.md**  
- **cross-platform-provenance-standard.md**  

These documents will expand the directory into a complete provenance reference architecture.
