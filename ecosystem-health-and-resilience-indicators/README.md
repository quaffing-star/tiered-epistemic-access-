# Ecosystem Health & Resilience Indicators  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the indicators, metrics, and monitoring frameworks used to assess the ongoing health, stability, and resilience of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Ecosystem health indicators help institutions detect emerging risks, monitor governance performance, and ensure long‑term sustainability.

These indicators provide early warning signals and guide proactive stewardship.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑health‑and‑resilience‑indicators directory provides:

- ecosystem health metrics  
- resilience and stability indicators  
- early warning signals  
- cross‑institution monitoring frameworks  
- long‑term sustainability measures  
- governance performance dashboards  

These tools ensure the ecosystem remains robust, adaptive, and aligned with public interest.
