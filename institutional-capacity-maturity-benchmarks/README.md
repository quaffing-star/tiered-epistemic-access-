# Institutional Capacity Maturity Benchmarks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines maturity benchmarks that help institutions evaluate their capacity, readiness, and operational sophistication within the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Maturity benchmarks provide structured tiers that describe how institutional capabilities evolve—from initial adoption to advanced, fully integrated governance excellence.

These benchmarks support continuous improvement, strategic planning, and cross‑institution alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The institutional‑capacity‑maturity‑benchmarks directory provides:

- maturity tier definitions  
- capability benchmarks for each tier  
- cross‑domain maturity indicators  
- institutional self‑assessment tools  
- improvement pathways and progression models  
- cross‑institution maturity alignment  

These tools help institutions understand their current level and plan their evolution.
