# Safety Constraints  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the safety constraints that govern how models operate within each epistemic layer.  
Safety constraints ensure that reasoning remains aligned with the capabilities, risks, and governance expectations of each layer, and that transitions between layers occur in a controlled, auditable manner.

These constraints form the backbone of safe deployment, certification, and oversight.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The safety‑constraints directory provides:

- layer‑specific safety rules  
- boundary enforcement requirements  
- downward‑migration safety criteria  
- adversarial‑resilience expectations  
- provenance‑linked safety checks  
- platform‑level enforcement guidelines  

These constraints ensure that epistemic access remains predictable, safe, and aligned with institutional governance.

## 🧩 Core Safety Constraint Categories

### **1. Layer‑Bound Reasoning Constraints**
Defines what a model *may* and *may not* do within a given layer:

- allowed reasoning depth  
- prohibited inference types  
- abstraction limits  
- domain‑specific restrictions  
- safety‑critical content boundaries  

### **2. Layer Transition Constraints**
Rules governing movement between layers:

- upward transition requirements  
- downward transition safety checks  
- provenance continuity  
- licensing and certification verification  
- audit trail updates  

### **3. Downward Migration Safety**
Constraints ensuring safe distillation:

- no leakage of sensitive or high‑risk content  
- abstraction fidelity requirements  
- safety filter application  
- provenance linkage  
- verification of safe generalization  

### **4. Adversarial‑Resilience Constraints**
Requirements for resisting misuse:

- prompt‑injection detection  
- reasoning‑boundary enforcement  
- red‑team scenario handling  
- anomaly detection triggers  
- fallback behavior  

### **5. Provenance‑Linked Safety**
Safety rules tied to provenance:

- mandatory trace logging  
- event‑level safety annotations  
- cross‑platform provenance compatibility  
- attestation requirements  

### **6. Certification‑Aligned Safety**
Constraints required for model certification:

- robustness thresholds  
- alignment stability  
- reproducibility of safety behavior  
- certification‑tier requirements
