# Public Transparency Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines frameworks, mechanisms, and communication models that ensure public transparency across all components of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Transparency is essential for public trust, regulatory legitimacy, institutional accountability, and cross‑platform coherence.

These frameworks help institutions communicate clearly about licensing, certification, provenance, safety, governance, and risk.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The public‑transparency‑frameworks directory provides:

- public‑facing transparency models  
- disclosure and reporting standards  
- explainability and accountability mechanisms  
- public auditability pathways  
- communication templates for institutions  
- cross‑platform transparency alignment  

These frameworks ensure the ecosystem remains understandable, trustworthy, and accountable.
