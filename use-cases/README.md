# Use Cases  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides concrete examples of how the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework can be applied across real‑world domains.  
While the concept note defines the architecture, the use cases illustrate how layered epistemic access improves safety, transparency, and capability in practical settings.

These examples help researchers, developers, and policymakers understand the framework’s value in action.

## 🎯 Purpose

The use‑cases directory provides:

- domain‑specific examples  
- scenario walkthroughs  
- layer‑specific reasoning demonstrations  
- licensing and certification interactions  
- provenance and audit implications  
- implementation considerations  

Each use case highlights how the framework changes outcomes compared to unlayered AI systems.
