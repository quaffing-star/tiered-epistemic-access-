# Ecosystem Impact Assessment Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines frameworks for assessing the social, institutional, technical, economic, and epistemic impacts of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Impact assessments ensure that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and public engagement produce positive outcomes and avoid unintended harms.

These frameworks help institutions evaluate the real‑world effects of adopting and operating the ecosystem.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑impact‑assessment‑frameworks directory provides:

- structured impact assessment models  
- multi‑dimensional evaluation criteria  
- public‑interest and societal impact tools  
- cross‑institution impact alignment  
- long‑term ecosystem health indicators  
- mitigation and improvement pathways  

These frameworks ensure the ecosystem remains beneficial, accountable, and aligned with human values.
