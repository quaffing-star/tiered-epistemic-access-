# Developer Tooling

This directory contains reference tools, examples, and implementation sketches that support developers working with the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework. These materials illustrate how to integrate epistemic layers, licensing checks, model certification gates, and downward‑migration workflows into real systems.

The goal of this section is to provide practical, modular resources that help developers explore, test, and implement the framework in applied settings.

## 📦 Contents (Planned)

Future additions to this directory may include:

- **Layer‑Switching API Sketches**  
  Example interfaces for requesting reasoning depth, verifying user licensing, and enforcing model certification boundaries.

- **Developer Filters & Wrappers**  
  Tools that demonstrate how to wrap model calls with epistemic constraints, provenance checks, and downward‑migration logic.

- **Debugging & Trace Utilities**  
  Scripts or examples showing how to inspect reasoning paths, layer transitions, and provenance chains.

- **Downward Migration Test Harness**  
  A small framework for testing whether higher‑layer outputs can be safely distilled into lower‑layer forms.

- **Curriculum‑Linked Developer Tools**  
  Examples showing how developer tools can integrate with human licensing modules or competency checks.

- **Implementation Pathway Examples**  
  Small, self‑contained examples illustrating how the framework can be embedded into real systems.

## 🎯 Purpose

The developer‑tooling directory is intended to:

- support experimentation  
- provide reference implementations  
- demonstrate best practices  
- help developers adopt the framework  
- bridge conceptual architecture with practical engineering  

As the project evolves, this directory will grow into a comprehensive toolkit for implementing layered epistemic access in real‑world systems.
