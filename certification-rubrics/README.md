# Certification Rubrics  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the evaluation rubrics used to certify AI models for operation at specific epistemic layers.  
Certification rubrics ensure that models demonstrate the safety, robustness, provenance integrity, and reasoning‑boundary discipline required for each layer.

These rubrics form the backbone of model certification, auditability, and cross‑platform trust.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The certification‑rubrics directory provides:

- layer‑specific evaluation criteria  
- scoring models and thresholds  
- reproducibility requirements  
- adversarial‑resilience benchmarks  
- provenance and audit expectations  
- certification‑tier definitions  

These rubrics support consistent, transparent, and standards‑aligned model certification.

### **2. Reasoning Discipline Rubric**
Evaluates:

- layer‑bound reasoning fidelity  
- abstraction level consistency  
- cross‑domain reasoning stability  
- avoidance of unauthorized upward transitions  
- reproducibility of reasoning paths  

### **3. Provenance & Auditability Rubric**
Evaluates:

- completeness of reasoning traces  
- event‑level provenance logging  
- cross‑platform provenance compatibility  
- attestation integrity  
- audit trail stability  

### **4. Robustness & Reliability Rubric**
Evaluates:

- resistance to prompt injection  
- stability under distribution shift  
- consistency across repeated evaluations  
- deterministic boundary checks  
- fallback behavior correctness  

### **5. Downward Migration Rubric**
Evaluates:

- abstraction fidelity  
- leakage prevention  
- safety filter application  
- provenance linkage  
- reproducibility of migration behavior  

### **6. Certification Tier Rubric**
Defines:

- minimum thresholds for each layer  
- scoring models (pass/fail or tiered)  
- reproducibility requirements  
- documentation and reporting standards  
- recertification intervals
