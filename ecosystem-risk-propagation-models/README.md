# Ecosystem Risk Propagation Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines models, diagrams, and analytical tools that describe how risks originate, propagate, amplify, and interact across the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Risk propagation models help institutions understand systemic vulnerabilities, anticipate cascading failures, and design interventions that prevent small issues from becoming ecosystem‑wide crises.

These models provide a scientific foundation for resilience, safety, and long‑term governance stability.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑risk‑propagation‑models directory provides:

- risk origin and propagation models  
- cross‑layer and cross‑institution risk pathways  
- systemic risk amplification patterns  
- containment and mitigation strategies  
- early warning propagation indicators  
- ecosystem‑wide risk mapping tools  

These models ensure the ecosystem can anticipate, detect, and interrupt harmful risk cascades.

## 🧩 Core Risk Propagation Model Categories

### **1. Cross‑Layer Risk Propagation Models**
Describe how risks move between epistemic layers:

- upward propagation (e.g., safety constraint failures)  
- downward propagation (e.g., misaligned reasoning)  
- lateral propagation across adjacent layers  
- multi‑layer amplification patterns  
- layer‑specific containment strategies  

### **2. Cross‑Institution Risk Propagation Models**
Describe how risks spread across organizations:

- governance decision spillover  
- certification or licensing failures  
- provenance stitching vulnerabilities  
- interoperability breakdowns  
- regulatory misalignment cascades  

### **3. Safety & Boundary Risk Propagation**
Describe how safety failures propagate:

- refusal behavior inconsistencies  
- adversarial prompt cascades  
- boundary‑condition erosion  
- safety constraint degradation  
- multi‑layer safety collapse scenarios  

### **4. Provenance & Attestation Risk Propagation**
Describe traceability‑related risks:

- corrupted attestation chains  
- cross‑platform stitching failures  
- provenance loss or truncation  
- auditability degradation  
- tamper‑evidence bypass cascades  

### **5. Certification & Licensing Risk Propagation**
Describe authorization‑related risks:

- evaluator bias propagation  
- licensing inequity cascades  
- competency model misalignment  
- cross‑institution reciprocity failures  
- appeals backlog amplification  

### **6. Interoperability & Standards Risk Propagation**
Describe cross‑platform technical risks:

- version mismatch cascades  
- standards divergence  
- regulatory conflict propagation  
- migration failure amplification  
- cross‑vendor incompatibility loops  

### **7. Public Trust & Social Risk Propagation**
Describe societal‑level risks:

- misinformation amplification  
- transparency breakdown cascades  
- public trust erosion  
- civil society escalation loops  
- public‑interest misalignment  

### **8. Systemic Risk Propagation Models**
Describe ecosystem‑wide dynamics:

- cascading governance failures  
- multi‑layer simultaneous breakdowns  
- cross‑institution risk synchronization  
- adversarial ecosystem‑wide attacks  
- long‑term systemic degradation
