# Ethical Precedent Library  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory contains a structured library of ethical precedents—documented decisions, analyses, and resolutions that illustrate how ethical principles and deliberation processes have been applied in practice.  
Ethical precedents help institutions learn from past decisions, ensure consistency, and build a shared ethical memory across the ecosystem.

These precedents serve as reference points for future ethical reviews and governance decisions.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ethical‑precedent‑library directory provides:

- documented ethical decisions  
- structured precedent summaries  
- cross‑institution ethical alignment  
- case‑based learning resources  
- transparency and accountability records  
- guidance for future deliberation  

These precedents strengthen ethical consistency and institutional wisdom.
