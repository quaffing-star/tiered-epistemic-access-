# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This FAQ provides quick answers to common questions about the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework, its purpose, and how it can be implemented or extended.

---

## ❓ What is the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework?

It is a structured architecture that separates AI reasoning into multiple epistemic layers, each with increasing depth, abstraction, and risk.  
Access to these layers is governed by human licensing, model certification, and institutional oversight.

---

## ❓ Why do we need epistemic layers?

Because not all reasoning is equally safe or equally appropriate for all users.  
Layering allows:

- safer exploration  
- clearer boundaries  
- reduced misuse  
- better alignment  
- transparent governance  

It mirrors systems like aviation, medicine, and amateur radio, where deeper capabilities require demonstrated competence.

---

## ❓ What is “human licensing”?

A competency‑based system that determines which epistemic layers a user can access.  
Licensing is supported by:

- curriculum frameworks  
- assessments  
- training modules  
- institutional oversight  

It ensures users understand the responsibilities and risks of deeper reasoning modes.

---

## ❓ What is “model certification”?

A process that evaluates whether an AI system can safely operate at specific epistemic layers.  
Certification checks include:

- adversarial robustness  
- provenance integrity  
- downward‑migration safety  
- reasoning‑boundary discipline  
- alignment stability  

Models must be certified before they can operate at deeper layers.

---

## ❓ What is “downward knowledge migration”?

A controlled process where higher‑layer reasoning is distilled into safe, generalized forms that can be used at lower layers.  
It prevents unsafe or overly specific content from leaking downward while still enabling learning and refinement.

---

## ❓ How does this framework relate to existing AI safety standards?

It complements existing standards by adding:

- structured reasoning layers  
- licensing and certification pathways  
- provenance and audit architecture  
- governance models  

It is designed to integrate with regulatory, academic, and industry ecosystems.

---

## ❓ Who is this framework for?

- AI governance researchers  
- standards bodies  
- policymakers  
- developers and platform architects  
- academic institutions  
- open‑source communities  
- safety engineers  

Anyone working on responsible AI deployment can use or adapt the framework.

---

## ❓ Is this a technical specification or a conceptual model?

It is currently a **conceptual architecture** with supporting documentation.  
However, it is structured to evolve into:

- technical specifications  
- certification criteria  
- curriculum standards  
- implementation guidelines  
- interoperability models  

The repository is designed to support that evolution.

---

## ❓ How can I contribute?

Contributions are welcome.  
Please see:

- `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`  

You can propose ideas, refine documentation, add diagrams, or help develop implementation pathways.

---

## ❓ Where should I start if I’m new?

Recommended reading order:

1. **ONE-PAGE-SUMMARY.md**  
2. **README.md**  
3. **SLIDE-DECK-OUTLINE.md**  
4. **concept-note/concept-note.md**  
5. Explore subdirectories based on interest (curriculum, certification, governance, provenance, etc.)

---

## ❓ What’s next for the project?

Planned additions include:

- expanded diagrams  
- governance blueprints  
- provenance schemas  
- implementation examples  
- curriculum modules  
- certification benchmarks  
- developer APIs  

See the repository’s roadmap (coming soon) for more details.
