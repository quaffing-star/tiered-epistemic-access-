# Compliance Checklists  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides structured checklists that help organizations verify compliance with the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These checklists translate governance, safety, certification, and provenance requirements into actionable, auditable items for platforms, developers, and institutions.

They serve as practical tools for audits, internal reviews, certification readiness, and regulatory alignment.

## 🎯 Purpose

The compliance‑checklists directory provides:

- layer‑specific compliance requirements  
- platform‑level enforcement checklists  
- certification readiness checklists  
- provenance and audit compliance items  
- safety and boundary‑enforcement verification  
- enterprise and regulatory compliance workflows  

These checklists ensure consistent, repeatable, and transparent adherence to the framework.
