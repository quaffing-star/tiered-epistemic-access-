# Education & Training Modules  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides structured education and training materials designed to help individuals, teams, and institutions learn, adopt, and operate the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These modules support competency development across licensing, certification, governance, safety, provenance, and cross‑institution coordination.

The goal is to build a skilled, informed, and aligned ecosystem of practitioners.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The education‑and‑training‑modules directory provides:

- structured learning modules  
- competency‑based training pathways  
- role‑specific curricula  
- hands‑on exercises and simulations  
- assessment and certification preparation  
- onboarding materials for new institutions  

These modules help learners build mastery at every layer of the framework.
