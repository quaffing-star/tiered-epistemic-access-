# Deployment Maturity Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines maturity models that help organizations assess their readiness, progress, and sophistication in deploying the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
Maturity models provide structured pathways for adoption, guiding institutions from initial exploration to fully integrated, interoperable, and auditable epistemic governance.

These models support strategic planning, capability development, and ecosystem alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The deployment‑maturity‑models directory provides:

- staged maturity levels  
- capability benchmarks  
- adoption readiness criteria  
- cross‑institution alignment indicators  
- governance and safety integration milestones  
- audit and compliance progression models  

These models help organizations understand where they are — and what comes next.

- provenance and attestation  
- safety constraint enforcement  
- transition rule implementation  
- monitoring and auditability  

### **2. Governance Maturity Model**
Tracks institutional governance capability:

- governance structure formation  
- playbook adoption  
- cross‑team coordination  
- incident response readiness  
- regulatory alignment  
- transparency and accountability  

### **3. Safety & Risk Maturity Model**
Tracks safety sophistication:

- adversarial‑resilience capability  
- boundary enforcement stability  
- downward‑migration reliability  
- risk classification and mitigation  
- safety incident handling  

### **4. Provenance & Attestation Maturity Model**
Tracks provenance integrity:

- trace completeness

- cross‑platform stitching  
- retention and export compliance  
- audit readiness  

### **5. Interoperability Maturity Model**
Tracks ecosystem alignment:

- licensing reciprocity  
- certification portability  
- provenance exchange compatibility  
- safety constraint equivalence  
- cross‑institution coordination  

### **6. Organizational Adoption Maturity Model**
Tracks enterprise‑level adoption:
