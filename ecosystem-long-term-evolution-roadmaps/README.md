# Ecosystem Long‑Term Evolution Roadmaps  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the long‑term evolution roadmaps that guide the strategic development, refinement, and expansion of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Roadmaps provide structured, forward‑looking plans that help institutions anticipate future needs, coordinate multi‑year development, and ensure that governance, safety, provenance, certification, interoperability, and observability components evolve coherently.

These roadmaps support long‑term planning, cross‑institution alignment, and ecosystem resilience across decades.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem long‑term evolution roadmaps provide:

- multi‑year governance and safety planning  
- phased ecosystem development strategies  
- cross‑institution alignment timelines  
- future‑state architectural visions  
- long‑term risk and resilience planning  
- coordinated ecosystem evolution pathways  

These tools help institutions prepare for future challenges, emerging technologies, and evolving governance requirements.
