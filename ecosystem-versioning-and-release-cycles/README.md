# Ecosystem Versioning & Release Cycles  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the versioning schemes, release cycles, and change‑management processes that govern how the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem evolves over time.  
Versioning ensures stability, predictability, and interoperability across institutions, platforms, certification bodies, and governance structures.

These frameworks help the ecosystem introduce improvements without disrupting safety, compliance, or cross‑institution alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑versioning‑and‑release‑cycles directory provides:

- versioning schemes for governance artifacts  
- structured release cycles  
- change‑management processes  
- deprecation and migration pathways  
- cross‑institution synchronization models  
- public transparency for ecosystem updates  

These mechanisms ensure the ecosystem evolves coherently and responsibly.

## 🧩 Core Versioning & Release Categories

### **1. Ecosystem Versioning Scheme**
Defines how the entire ecosystem is versioned:

- semantic versioning for governance artifacts  
- major, minor, and patch release definitions  
- compatibility guarantees  
- cross‑layer version alignment  
- version provenance and attestation  

### **2. Governance Release Cycle**
Defines how governance updates are introduced:

- scheduled governance releases  
- emergency governance patches  
- public consultation windows  
- cross‑institution review cycles  
- amendment and ratification processes  

### **3. Safety & Risk Release Cycle**
Defines how safety evolves:

- safety constraint updates  
- adversarial‑resilience patches  
- risk classification revisions  
- downward‑migration refinements  
- safety incident‑driven releases  

### **4. Certification & Licensing Release Cycle**
Defines how authorization systems evolve:

- competency model updates  
- certification rubric revisions  
- licensing tier expansions  
- cross‑institution reciprocity updates  
- public transparency releases  

### **5. Provenance & Attestation Release Cycle**
Defines how integrity mechanisms evolve:

- attestation format updates  
- provenance schema revisions  
- stitching protocol upgrades  
- auditability enhancements  
- backward‑compatibility guarantees  

### **6. Interoperability & Standards Release Cycle**
Defines how cross‑platform alignment evolves:

- interoperability standard updates  
- cross‑vendor compatibility releases  
- regulatory alignment cycles  
- multi‑stakeholder harmonization  
- deprecation and migration timelines  

### **7. Public Release & Communication Framework**
Defines how updates are communicated:

- public release notes  
- version dashboards  
- change‑impact summaries  
- migration guides  
- public transparency commitments
