# Tiered Epistemic Access Framework
*A Structured Architecture for Responsible AI Reasoning, Training, and Governance*

The Tiered Epistemic Access Framework proposes a multi-layer architecture for AI systems that aligns reasoning depth with user competence, model capability, and institutional oversight. It introduces a structured approach to epistemic access, human licensing, model certification, curriculum-based training, and downward knowledge migration — forming a complete ecosystem for responsible AI development and deployment.

This repository contains the full concept note, supporting materials, diagrams, curriculum frameworks, and certification structures that define the architecture.

## 📘 Concept Note

The core of this repository is the formal concept note:

**`concept-note/concept-note.md`**

It outlines the full architecture, including:

- epistemic layers  
- user-side filters  
- training architecture  
- downward knowledge migration  
- human licensing  
- model certification  
- governance pathways  
- research applications  
- implementation strategies  

PDF exports will be added to:

**`concept-note/pdf-export/`**

## 🧠 Core Ideas

### 1. Epistemic Layers
AI reasoning is separated into progressively deeper layers, each with increasing complexity, abstraction, and risk. Access is governed by licensing and model certification.

### 2. Human Licensing
Users must demonstrate competency to access deeper reasoning modes.  
Competencies are defined in the **Licensing Curriculum Framework**.

### 3. Model Certification
AI systems themselves must be certified to operate safely within deeper layers.  
Certification evaluates:

- adversarial robustness  
- provenance integrity  
- downward migration safety  
- alignment stability  
- layer-bound reasoning discipline  

### 4. Downward Knowledge Migration
Higher layers act as refinement engines, distilling complex or adversarial knowledge into safe, generalized forms that can migrate downward into lower layers.

### 5. Curriculum-Based Training
Human licensing is supported by a structured competency framework, similar to aviation, medicine, or amateur radio.

### 6. Governance & Oversight
The framework integrates:

- licensing authorities  
- model certification bodies  
- audit trails  
- interpretability tools  
- developer APIs  
- institutional responsibilities
