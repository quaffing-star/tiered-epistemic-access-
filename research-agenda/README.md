# Research Agenda  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory outlines the open research questions, exploratory directions, and long‑term scientific inquiries that support the development of the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
It is intended for researchers, standards bodies, academic groups, and technical teams interested in advancing the theory and practice of layered epistemic access.

The research agenda is modular and evolving.

## 🎯 Purpose

The research‑agenda directory provides:

- foundational research questions  
- exploratory pathways  
- interdisciplinary connections  
- open problems in epistemic governance  
- opportunities for empirical study  
- long‑term scientific goals  

It serves as a guide for contributors who want to push the boundaries of the framework.

## 🔍 Open Questions (Examples)

- How can epistemic layers be formally defined and measured?  
- What is the optimal granularity of layer boundaries?  
- How do humans internalize epistemic discipline?  
- What metrics best capture downward‑migration safety?  
- How can provenance be made interoperable across platforms?  
- What governance structures scale globally?  
- How can certification pipelines remain transparent and reproducible?  

These questions will evolve as the framework matures.
