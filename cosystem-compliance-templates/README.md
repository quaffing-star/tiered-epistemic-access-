# Ecosystem Compliance Templates  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides standardized compliance templates that institutions can use to demonstrate alignment with the governance, safety, provenance, certification, and interoperability requirements of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
These templates ensure consistency, clarity, and auditability across institutions while reducing the burden of creating compliance documentation from scratch.

Compliance templates support onboarding, certification, audits, renewals, and cross‑institution verification.

- standardized compliance documentation  
- audit‑ready reporting structures  
- certification and licensing templates  
- safety and provenance verification forms
