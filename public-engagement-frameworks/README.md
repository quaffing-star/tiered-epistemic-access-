# Public Engagement Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines frameworks that enable meaningful public engagement with the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Public engagement ensures that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and long‑term evolution remain aligned with societal values, democratic accountability, and public interest.

These frameworks help institutions create structured, accessible, and inclusive pathways for public participation.
