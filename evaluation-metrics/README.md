# Evaluation Metrics  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines quantitative and qualitative metrics used to evaluate models, platforms, and governance processes within the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
Evaluation metrics provide the measurable backbone for certification, safety validation, provenance integrity, and cross‑platform interoperability.

These metrics ensure that the framework is not only conceptually sound but empirically verifiable.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The evaluation‑metrics directory provides:

- measurable criteria for model certification  
- safety and robustness metrics  
- provenance completeness and integrity metrics  
- layer‑transition performance metrics  
- downward‑migration fidelity metrics  
- governance and compliance metrics  

These metrics support reproducible evaluation, auditability, and standards‑aligned benchmarking.

## 🧩 Core Metric Categories

### **1. Safety & Alignment Metrics**
Quantify how safely a model behaves:

- refusal correctness rate  
- boundary‑enforcement accuracy  
- adversarial‑prompt detection rate  
- safety‑filter precision/recall  
- harmful‑content leakage rate  
- downward‑migration safety score  

### **2. Reasoning Discipline Metrics**
Measure adherence to layer‑bound reasoning:

- layer‑fidelity score  
- abstraction‑level consistency  
- unauthorized upward transition rate  
- cross‑domain reasoning stability  
- reproducibility of reasoning paths  

### **3. Provenance Metrics**
Evaluate provenance completeness and integrity:

- event‑logging completeness  
- trace continuity score  
- attestation validity rate  
- cross‑platform provenance compatibility  
- retention and export compliance  

### **4. Robustness & Reliability Metrics**
Assess model stability under stress:

- prompt‑injection robustness  
- distribution‑shift stability  
- repeated‑query consistency  
- deterministic boundary checks  
- fallback behavior correctness  

### **5. Downward Migration Metrics**
Measure the quality and safety of abstraction:

- abstraction fidelity score  
- leakage‑prevention rate  
- safety‑filter application accuracy  
- provenance linkage completeness  
- reproducibility of migration behavior  

### **6. Transition Performance Metrics**
Evaluate transitions between layers:

- upward transition success rate  
- downward migration invocation rate  
- transition refusal correctness  
- transition latency  
- transition provenance completeness  

### **7. Platform Compliance Metrics**
Quantify platform‑level adherence:

- licensing enforcement accuracy  
- certification validation rate  
- safety‑constraint enforcement rate  
- audit trail completeness  
- multi‑tenant isolation score
