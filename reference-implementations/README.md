# Reference Implementations  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides minimal, illustrative reference implementations that demonstrate how the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework can be applied in real systems.  
These examples are intentionally lightweight and conceptual — they are not production‑ready, but they show how licensing, certification, provenance, safety constraints, and layer transitions can be implemented in practice.

The goal is to give developers and researchers a concrete starting point for building compliant systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The reference‑implementations directory provides:

- minimal working examples  
- conceptual code patterns  
- layer‑request workflows  
- licensing and certification checks  
- provenance‑linked reasoning flows  
- downward‑migration demonstrations  
- safe refusal and fallback behavior  

These examples help bridge the gap between conceptual architecture and real‑world engineering.

## 🧩 Planned Reference Implementations

### **1. Minimal Layer Request Example**
A tiny implementation showing:

- how a user requests a layer  
- how licensing is checked  
- how model certification is validated  
- how provenance is initialized  
- how refusal behavior works  

### **2. Downward Migration Demonstration**
A simple example showing:

- a higher‑layer reasoning output  
- abstraction and safety filtering  
- provenance linkage  
- safe downward migration to a lower layer  

### **3. Provenance Trace Example**
A minimal provenance logger showing:

- event creation  
- trace stitching  
- attestation metadata  
- export in a standardized format  

### **4. Layer Transition Engine**
A conceptual engine that:

- enforces upward and downward transitions  
- validates safety constraints  
- logs transition events  
- triggers downward migration when required  

### **5. Licensing Verification Stub**
A mock licensing authority integration:

- license lookup  
- competency level validation  
- expiration checks  
- refusal behavior  

### **6. Certification Registry Stub**
A mock certification registry:

- certification tier lookup  
- recertification metadata  
- provenance of certification  
- fallback behavior  

### **7. Safe Reasoning Sandbox**
A minimal sandbox showing:

- layer‑bound reasoning  
- adversarial‑prompt detection  
- refusal and fallback logic  
- provenance‑linked output
