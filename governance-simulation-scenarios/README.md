# Governance Simulation Scenarios  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory contains structured simulation scenarios designed to test, validate, and stress‑test governance processes within the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These simulations help institutions rehearse decision‑making, evaluate governance resilience, and identify gaps in safety, certification, provenance, and cross‑institution coordination.

Governance simulations are essential for preparing real‑world operators to handle complex, high‑stakes situations.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The governance‑simulation‑scenarios directory provides:

- realistic governance stress tests  
- scenario‑based decision exercises  
- cross‑team coordination drills  
- failure‑mode rehearsals  
- regulatory and audit simulations  
- multi‑stakeholder negotiation scenarios  

These simulations help governance bodies build operational maturity and resilience.

## 🧩 Core Simulation Categories

### **1. Licensing Authority Simulation**
Scenarios that test licensing governance:

- borderline competency cases  
- license suspension or revocation  
- appeals and remediation  
- cross‑institution license recognition  
- fraudulent license detection  

### **2. Model Certification Simulation**
Scenarios that test certification bodies:

- certification disputes  
- recertification under time pressure  
- certification drift detection  
- cross‑vendor certification conflicts  
- emergency suspension of a model  

### **3. Platform Governance Simulation**
Scenarios that test platform operators:

- safety incident escalation  
- adversarial prompt outbreak  
- multi‑tenant isolation failure  
- provenance trace corruption  
- unauthorized upward transition attempts  

### **4. Provenance Oversight Simulation**
Scenarios that test provenance auditors:

- incomplete trace detection  
- cross‑platform stitching failures  
- attestation mismatch  
- tampering investigation  
- retention policy violations  

### **5. Safety & Risk Management Simulation**
Scenarios that test safety teams:

- red‑team attack escalation  
- boundary‑violation cascade  
- downward‑migration failure  
- safety filter malfunction  
- cross‑layer risk propagation  

### **6. Multi‑Stakeholder Governance Simulation**
Scenarios that test collaborative governance:

- conflicting institutional policies  
- certification reciprocity disputes  
- cross‑platform safety alignment  
- public accountability crises  
- multi‑agency coordination failures  

### **7. Regulatory Simulation**
Scenarios that test regulatory alignment:

- audit readiness drills  
- regulatory conflict resolution  
- cross‑jurisdiction compliance  
- emergency regulatory intervention  
- public transparency requirements
