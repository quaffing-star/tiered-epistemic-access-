# Long‑Term Governance Roadmaps  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines long‑term governance roadmaps that guide the evolution, renewal, and strategic direction of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Roadmaps provide multi‑year trajectories for governance, safety, certification, provenance, interoperability, and public accountability.

These documents help institutions plan for the future, anticipate ecosystem shifts, and coordinate long‑term development across platforms and stakeholders.

## 🎯 Purpose

The long‑term‑governance‑roadmaps directory provides:

- multi‑year governance trajectories  
- ecosystem evolution plans  
- versioning and release cycles  
- long‑term safety and risk strategies  
- certification and licensing evolution  
- cross‑institution alignment timelines  
- public‑interest and regulatory roadmaps  

These roadmaps ensure the ecosystem evolves coherently, responsibly, and transparently.
