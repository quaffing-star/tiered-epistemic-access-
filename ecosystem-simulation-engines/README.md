# Ecosystem Simulation Engines  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the simulation engines used to model, test, and explore the behavior of governance, safety, provenance, certification, interoperability, and observability components within the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Simulation engines allow institutions to run controlled experiments, evaluate system dynamics, test edge cases, and explore long‑term ecosystem evolution without impacting production environments.

These engines support scenario modeling, stress testing, risk propagation analysis, and multi‑ecosystem coordination experiments.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem simulation engines provide:

- controlled simulation environments  
- dynamic ecosystem behavior modeling  
- scenario‑based governance and safety testing  
- long‑term evolution forecasting  
- cross‑ecosystem interaction modeling  
- risk propagation and mitigation experimentation  

These tools help institutions understand complex system behavior and validate governance decisions before real‑world deployment.
