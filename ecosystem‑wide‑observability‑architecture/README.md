# Ecosystem-Wide Observability Architecture  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the observability architecture that enables institutions to monitor, measure, and understand the behavior of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem in real time.  
Observability ensures that governance, safety, provenance, certification, and interoperability systems remain transparent, measurable, and accountable.

This architecture provides the foundation for dashboards, metrics, telemetry, alerting, and long-term ecosystem health monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem-wide observability architecture provides:

- unified observability principles  
- cross-layer monitoring structures  
- telemetry and signal flow models  
- ecosystem-wide health indicators  
- observability integration patterns  
- monitoring and alerting foundations  

These tools help institutions understand system behavior, detect anomalies, and maintain ecosystem integrity.
