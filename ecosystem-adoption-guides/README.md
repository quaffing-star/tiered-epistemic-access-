# Ecosystem Adoption Guides  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides practical guides for organizations, platforms, governments, research groups, and open‑source communities seeking to adopt the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These guides translate the architecture into actionable adoption pathways, helping institutions integrate layered epistemic access into their governance, engineering, and operational ecosystems.

The goal is to support smooth, scalable, and interoperable adoption across diverse environments.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑adoption‑guides directory provides:

- adoption roadmaps for different institution types  
- integration strategies for platforms and vendors  
- governance alignment guidance  
- regulatory and policy adoption pathways  
- open‑source community onboarding  
- cross‑institution coordination models  

These guides help organizations adopt the framework responsibly and effectively.
