### 1. Propose Improvements or Ideas
If you have suggestions for improving the framework, please open an issue describing:

Please ensure documentation changes remain consistent with the conceptual foundations of the framework.

### 3. Add New Materials
If you are contributing new documents (e.g., diagrams, curriculum modules, certification criteria), place them in the appropriate folder:

- `concept-note/`  
- `curriculum-framework/`  
- `model-certification/`  
- `license/`  

If unsure where something belongs, open an issue first.
