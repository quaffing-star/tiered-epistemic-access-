- **Interoperability** — Additions should integrate cleanly with other components of the ecosystem.  
- **Safety & Governance Alignment** — Contributions must reinforce ecosystem safety, provenance, and governance commitments.  
- **Long‑Term Maintainability** — Documents should be future‑proof, modular, and easy to update.  
- **Cross‑Institution Neutrality** — Content should remain institution‑agnostic and globally applicable.
