# Cross‑Institution Coordination Protocols  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines protocols that enable multiple institutions—platforms, regulators, certification bodies, research labs, enterprises, and open‑source communities—to coordinate effectively within the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
These protocols ensure that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and risk management remain consistent across organizational boundaries.

Cross‑institution coordination is essential for building a coherent, trustworthy, and scalable epistemic ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The cross‑institution‑coordination‑protocols directory provides:

- shared coordination mechanisms  
- escalation and communication protocols  
- cross‑platform governance alignment  
- certification and licensing reciprocity models  
- provenance and attestation exchange workflows  
- multi‑stakeholder decision‑making structures  

These protocols support ecosystem‑wide coherence and resilience.

## 🧩 Core Coordination Protocol Categories

### **1. Licensing Reciprocity Protocol**
Defines how institutions recognize each other’s licenses:

- competency level equivalence  
- cross‑institution license validation  
- revocation and suspension propagation  
- privacy‑preserving license proofs  
- dispute resolution pathways  

### **2. Certification Reciprocity Protocol**
Ensures model certifications are portable:

- certification tier equivalence  
- cross‑vendor certification recognition  
- recertification synchronization  
- emergency suspension propagation  
- certification provenance exchange  

### **3. Provenance Exchange Protocol**
Defines how provenance traces move across institutions:

- standardized provenance envelopes  
- event‑level stitching rules  
- attestation verification  
- retention and export compatibility  
- cross‑platform auditability  

### **4. Safety Coordination Protocol**
Ensures safety enforcement is aligned across organizations:

- shared safety constraint definitions  
- cross‑platform adversarial‑signal alerts  
- coordinated safety incident response  
- downward‑migration equivalence  
- safety filter compatibility  

### **5. Governance Coordination Protocol**
Defines how governance bodies collaborate:

- shared decision‑making frameworks  
- conflict resolution models  
- transparency and reporting standards  
- multi‑stakeholder governance cycles  
- cross‑institution accountability  

### **6. Risk Propagation & Mitigation Protocol**
Ensures risks are shared and mitigated across institutions:

- risk classification alignment  
- cross‑platform risk propagation alerts  
- coordinated mitigation strategies  
- systemic risk monitoring  
- joint incident response  

### **7. Regulatory Coordination Protocol**
Supports alignment with regulators:

- audit data exchange  
- regulatory compliance synchronization  
- cross‑jurisdiction harmonization  
- emergency regulatory intervention workflows  
- public accountability mechanisms
