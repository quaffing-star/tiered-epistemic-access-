# Ecosystem Stress Testing Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines stress‑testing methodologies, simulation models, and resilience evaluation tools that assess how the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem performs under adverse, extreme, or unexpected conditions.  
Stress testing ensures that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and cross‑institution coordination remain robust even when the ecosystem is under strain.

These frameworks help institutions identify weaknesses, validate resilience, and strengthen long‑term stability.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑stress‑testing‑frameworks directory provides:

- structured stress‑testing methodologies  
- adversarial and failure scenario models  
- cross‑institution stress simulations  
- resilience evaluation tools  
- governance overload tests  
- safety and provenance stress conditions  

These tools ensure the ecosystem can withstand shocks, failures, and adversarial pressures.

## 🧩 Core Stress Testing Categories

### **1. Governance Stress Tests**
Evaluate governance under strain:

- decision‑making overload  
- cross‑institution coordination breakdown  
- conflicting governance directives  
- emergency amendment scenarios  
- transparency under crisis conditions  

### **2. Safety & Boundary Stress Tests**
Evaluate safety mechanisms under extreme conditions:

- adversarial prompt barrages  
- rapid multi‑layer transitions  
- boundary‑condition saturation  
- safety constraint degradation  
- downward‑migration overload  

### **3. Provenance & Attestation Stress Tests**
Evaluate traceability under pressure:

- high‑volume provenance generation  
- cross‑platform stitching failures  
- attestation corruption attempts  
- audit overload scenarios  
- tamper‑evidence stress conditions  

### **4. Certification & Licensing Stress Tests**
Evaluate authorization systems under strain:

- mass licensing requests  
- certification backlog scenarios  
- cross‑institution reciprocity failures  
- appeals and remediation overload  
- competency model stress conditions  

### **5. Interoperability & Standards Stress Tests**
Evaluate cross‑platform alignment under stress:

- version mismatch scenarios  
- standards divergence simulations  
- cross‑vendor compatibility failures  
- regulatory conflict conditions  
- deprecation and migration overload  

### **6. Public Engagement & Transparency Stress Tests**
Evaluate public‑facing systems under pressure:

- high‑volume public feedback  
- transparency reporting overload  
- civil society escalation scenarios  
- public trust shock events  
- misinformation or misinterpretation surges  

### **7. Ecosystem‑Wide Shock Simulations**
Evaluate systemic resilience:

- multi‑layer simultaneous failures  
- cascading governance breakdowns  
- cross‑institution risk propagation  
- adversarial ecosystem‑wide attacks  
- long‑term degradation scenarios
