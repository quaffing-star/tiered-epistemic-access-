# Institutional Capacity Building Guides  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides structured guides, tools, and development pathways that help institutions build the internal capacity required to adopt, operate, and sustain the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Capacity building ensures that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and public engagement can be implemented effectively across organizations of varying sizes and maturity levels.

These guides support long‑term institutional resilience, competence, and readiness.
