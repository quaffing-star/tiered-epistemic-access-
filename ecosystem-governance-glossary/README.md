# Ecosystem Governance Glossary  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides a comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
A shared vocabulary is essential for clarity, consistency, and cross‑institution alignment—especially in a governance architecture that spans safety, provenance, certification, interoperability, observability, and federated coordination.

The glossary ensures that all participants—technical, governance, legal, and operational—use the same language with the same meaning.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem governance glossary provides:

- standardized definitions for key governance terms  
- cross‑domain terminology alignment  
- consistent language across institutions  
- clarity for onboarding and training  
- shared conceptual foundations  
- reduced ambiguity in governance and safety discussions  

These definitions help institutions communicate clearly and avoid misinterpretation across diverse roles and ecosystems.
