# Monitoring & Alerting Frameworks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the monitoring and alerting frameworks that enable institutions to detect anomalies, identify risks, and respond rapidly to issues across the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Monitoring and alerting systems ensure that governance, safety, provenance, certification, and interoperability components remain reliable, predictable, and accountable.

These frameworks provide the operational backbone for real-time oversight and incident response.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The monitoring and alerting frameworks provide:

- standardized monitoring structures  
- alerting rules and escalation pathways  
- cross-layer anomaly detection  
- incident classification and severity models  
- monitoring integration patterns  
- ecosystem-wide alert coordination  

These tools help institutions maintain situational awareness and respond effectively to emerging issues.

## 🧩 Core Monitoring & Alerting Components

### **1. Monitoring Principles**
Defines foundational principles:

- reliability  
- minimal false positives  
- interpretability  
- cross-layer visibility  
- timely detection  
- actionable insights  

### **2. Monitoring Architecture**
Covers all ecosystem layers:

- governance monitoring  
- safety constraint monitoring  
- provenance and attestation monitoring  
- certification and licensing monitoring  
- interoperability monitoring  
- public engagement monitoring  

### **3. Alerting Framework**
Defines alerting structures:

- alert types  
- severity levels  
- escalation pathways  
- notification channels  
- cross-institution alert coordination  

### **4. Anomaly Detection Models**
Provides detection strategies:

- rule-based detection  
- statistical anomaly detection  
- behavioral deviation detection  
- cross-layer correlation models  
- ecosystem-wide anomaly propagation analysis  

### **5. Incident Response Integration**
Defines how alerts connect to response workflows:

- incident classification  
- triage workflows  
- response timelines  
- cross-institution coordination  
- post-incident review integration  

### **6. Monitoring Integration Patterns**
Reusable patterns for implementation:

- sidecar monitoring  
- embedded monitoring  
- external monitoring agents  
- federated monitoring models  
- multi-institution monitoring bridges
