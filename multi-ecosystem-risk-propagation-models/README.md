# Multi‑Ecosystem Risk Propagation Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the models, structures, and analytical tools used to understand how risks propagate across multiple governance ecosystems, institutions, and AI systems.  
Risk propagation modeling ensures that institutions can anticipate how failures, misalignments, or vulnerabilities in one ecosystem may influence others—especially in environments where governance, safety, provenance, and interoperability systems are interconnected.

These models support proactive risk mitigation, cross‑ecosystem coordination, and long‑term ecosystem resilience.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The multi‑ecosystem risk propagation models provide:

- cross‑ecosystem risk mapping  
- propagation pathways and influence diagrams  
- systemic risk analysis  
- cascading failure modeling  
- cross‑institution risk correlation  
- ecosystem‑wide mitigation strategies  

These tools help institutions anticipate and manage risks that extend beyond their immediate governance environment.

## 🧩 Core Risk Propagation Components

### **1. Risk Propagation Principles**
Defines foundational principles:

- transparency  
- early detection  
- systemic awareness  
- cross‑ecosystem accountability  
- minimal coupling  
- resilience by design  

### **2. Propagation Pathways**
Identifies how risks move across ecosystems:

- governance decision propagation  
- safety constraint propagation  
- provenance and attestation failures  
- licensing and certification inconsistencies  
- interoperability breakdowns  
- public trust erosion  

### **3. Cascading Failure Models**
Provides models for:

- single‑point failures  
- multi‑point correlated failures  
- cross‑ecosystem chain reactions  
- feedback loops  
- systemic collapse scenarios  

### **4. Cross‑Ecosystem Risk Correlation**
Defines correlation structures:

- shared dependencies  
- shared data flows  
- shared governance roles  
- shared safety constraints  
- shared provenance systems  

### **5. Systemic Risk Indicators**
Defines ecosystem‑level indicators:

- fragility index  
- propagation likelihood  
- cross‑ecosystem exposure score  
- resilience readiness index  
- recovery time estimates  

### **6. Mitigation & Containment Strategies**
Provides strategies for:

- risk isolation  
- propagation dampening  
- cross‑ecosystem coordination  
- redundancy and fallback systems  
- rapid response and containment
