# Interoperability Standards  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines interoperability standards that enable multiple platforms, vendors, institutions, and regulatory bodies to adopt the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework in a consistent and compatible way.  
Interoperability ensures that licensing, certification, provenance, safety, and layer transitions work across diverse systems without fragmentation.

These standards support cross‑platform trust, portability, and ecosystem‑wide alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The interoperability‑standards directory provides:

- cross‑vendor compatibility models  
- shared data formats and schemas  
- provenance exchange standards  
- certification and licensing interoperability  
- safety and transition consistency requirements  
- governance alignment across institutions  

These standards ensure that the framework can scale across organizations and platforms.

## 🧩 Core Interoperability Areas

### **1. Licensing Interoperability**
Defines how licensing information can be shared across platforms:

- standardized license tokens  
- competency level encoding  
- expiration and renewal metadata  
- cross‑institution verification  
- privacy‑preserving license proofs  

### **2. Model Certification Interoperability**
Ensures certification is portable across vendors:

- certification tier encoding  
- certification registry interoperability  
- cross‑vendor attestation formats  
- recertification compatibility  
- certification provenance exchange  

### **3. Provenance Interoperability**
Defines how provenance traces move across systems:

- standardized provenance schema  
- event‑level metadata formats  
- cross‑platform trace stitching  
- attestation verification  
- retention and export standards  

### **4. Safety Constraint Interoperability**
Ensures safety rules remain consistent across platforms:

- shared safety constraint definitions  
- cross‑platform enforcement expectations  
- adversarial‑resilience compatibility  
- downward‑migration safety equivalence  
- refusal behavior consistency  

### **5. Layer Transition Interoperability**
Ensures transitions behave the same across systems:

- standardized transition event formats  
- upward/downward transition metadata  
- boundary enforcement equivalence  
- transition refusal codes  
- audit trail interoperability  

### **6. API Interoperability**
Defines how APIs communicate across vendors:

- layer request formats  
- licensing and certification headers  
- provenance‑linked request/response envelopes  
- error and refusal codes  
- cross‑platform versioning  

### **7. Governance Interoperability**
Ensures institutions can coordinate:

- shared governance vocabulary  
- cross‑institution compliance models  
- regulatory alignment templates  
- audit exchange formats  
- multi‑stakeholder governance protocols
