# Reference Sandbox Environments  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the reference sandbox environments used to test, validate, and demonstrate the behavior of governance, safety, provenance, certification, and interoperability components within the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Sandboxes provide controlled, observable, and reproducible environments where institutions can experiment, evaluate system behavior, and validate compliance before deploying changes into production ecosystems.

These environments support safe experimentation, cross‑institution collaboration, and transparent evaluation of governance mechanisms.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The reference sandbox environments provide:

- standardized testing environments  
- controlled governance and safety simulations  
- reproducible evaluation conditions  
- cross‑institution experimentation spaces  
- integration testing for ecosystem components  
- safe environments for stress and failure testing  

These tools help institutions validate system behavior without risking production environments.

## 🧩 Core Sandbox Components

### **1. Sandbox Principles**
Defines foundational principles:

- safety  
- isolation  
- reproducibility  
- transparency  
- observability  
- low risk  

### **2. Sandbox Types**
Provides multiple sandbox categories:

- governance sandboxes  
- safety constraint sandboxes  
- provenance and attestation sandboxes  
- licensing and certification sandboxes  
- interoperability sandboxes  
- multi‑ecosystem simulation sandboxes  

### **3. Sandbox Architecture**
Defines architectural components:

- isolated execution environments  
- synthetic data generators  
- event replay systems  
- scenario injection modules  
- observability and telemetry hooks  
- rollback and reset mechanisms  

### **4. Scenario Libraries**
Supports scenario‑based testing:

- governance decision scenarios  
- safety constraint edge cases  
- provenance failure scenarios  
- licensing workflow variations  
- interoperability stress scenarios  
- multi‑ecosystem propagation scenarios  

### **5. Evaluation & Validation Tools**
Provides tools for:

- automated test execution  
- scenario scoring  
- compliance validation  
- safety constraint evaluation  
- provenance integrity checks  
- interoperability compatibility testing  

### **6. Cross‑Institution Sandbox Collaboration**
Defines collaboration structures:

- shared sandbox instances  
- federated sandbox networks  
- cross‑institution scenario sharing  
- multi‑party evaluation workflows  
- sandbox transparency reporting
