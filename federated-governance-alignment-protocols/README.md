# Federated Governance Alignment Protocols  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the protocols that enable multiple institutions, jurisdictions, and governance ecosystems to coordinate, align, and interoperate without requiring centralization.  
Federated governance alignment ensures that diverse actors can maintain autonomy while still participating in shared governance, safety, provenance, and interoperability structures.

These protocols support distributed decision-making, cross-institution alignment, and multi-stakeholder coordination.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The federated governance alignment protocols provide:

- decentralized governance coordination  
- cross-institution alignment mechanisms  
- shared decision-making structures  
- federated safety and provenance verification  
- multi-stakeholder governance workflows  
- alignment without centralization  

These tools help institutions collaborate while preserving independence, diversity, and local governance requirements.

## 🧩 Core Federated Governance Components

### **1. Federated Governance Principles**
Defines foundational principles:

- autonomy  
- interoperability  
- transparency  
- accountability  
- mutual recognition  
- minimal coordination overhead  

### **2. Alignment Protocols**
Defines how institutions align:

- shared governance signals  
- cross-institution decision synchronization  
- federated ethical review  
- distributed safety constraint alignment  
- multi-institution provenance verification  

### **3. Federated Decision-Making Models**
Provides models for:

- consensus  
- supermajority  
- weighted voting  
- rotating stewardship  
- multi-tiered governance councils  

### **4. Cross-Institution Coordination Structures**
Defines structures for:

- federated governance committees  
- shared release cycles  
- joint safety reviews  
- cross-institution incident response  
- federated transparency reporting  

### **5. Federated Trust Models**
Defines trust-building mechanisms:

- attestation exchange  
- cross-institution credential verification  
- federated identity models  
- trust scoring and stability indicators  
- multi-party auditability  

### **6. Governance Bridging Patterns**
Reusable patterns for connecting governance systems:

- governance translation layers  
- role equivalence mapping  
- federated policy adapters  
- cross-ecosystem governance stitching  
- distributed governance gateways
