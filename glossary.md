# Glossary  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
It provides a shared vocabulary for researchers, developers, policymakers, and contributors.

---

## **A**

### **Access Control**
Mechanisms that determine which epistemic layers a user or model may access, based on licensing, certification, or platform enforcement.

### **Adversarial Robustness**
A model’s ability to resist manipulation, prompt injection, or reasoning exploits that attempt to bypass epistemic boundaries.

---

## **C**

### **Certification (Model Certification)**
A formal evaluation process that determines whether an AI system can safely operate at specific epistemic layers.

### **Competency Framework**
A structured set of skills, knowledge areas, and assessments used to determine user licensing levels.

### **Concept Note**
The primary document describing the architecture, rationale, and structure of the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.

---

## **D**

### **Downward Knowledge Migration**
The controlled process of distilling higher‑layer reasoning into safe, generalized forms suitable for lower layers.

### **Distillation**
A transformation that simplifies or abstracts complex reasoning while preserving essential meaning and safety.

---

## **E**

### **Epistemic Layer**
A defined level of reasoning depth within the framework, each with its own capabilities, constraints, and risk profile.

### **Epistemic Boundary**
A conceptual and technical limit that prevents reasoning from crossing into deeper layers without authorization.

---

## **G**

### **Governance Model**
The institutional structure that defines how licensing, certification, oversight, and enforcement are managed.

---

## **H**

### **Human Licensing**
A competency‑based system that determines which epistemic layers a user may access.

---

## **I**

### **Implementation Pathway**
A practical route for adopting the framework within institutions, platforms, or technical ecosystems.

---

## **L**

### **Layer‑Bound Reasoning**
Reasoning that is constrained to the capabilities and safety requirements of a specific epistemic layer.

### **Licensing Authority**
An institution responsible for issuing, managing, and revoking human licenses for epistemic access.

---

## **M**

### **Migration Safety**
The assurance that downward‑migrated knowledge does not leak unsafe, overly specific, or adversarial content.

### **Model Certification Body**
An institution responsible for evaluating and certifying AI systems for layer‑specific operation.

---

## **P**

### **Provenance**
The traceable history of how an output was generated, including inputs, reasoning steps, layer transitions, and safety transformations.

### **Provenance Architecture**
The system of logs, traces, attestations, and verification mechanisms that ensure transparency and accountability.

---

## **R**

### **Reasoning Trace**
A structured record of the reasoning steps taken by a model, including layer origin and applied constraints.

### **Refinement Engine**
A higher‑layer reasoning process that transforms complex or sensitive knowledge into safer, generalized forms.

---

## **S**

### **Standards‑Body Integration**
The alignment of the framework with existing or emerging technical, regulatory, or safety standards.

---

## **T**

### **Traceability**
The ability to follow the full lineage of an output, from input to reasoning to final form.

---

## **U**

### **User Competency**
A user’s demonstrated ability to safely interact with deeper epistemic layers, determined through licensing assessments.
