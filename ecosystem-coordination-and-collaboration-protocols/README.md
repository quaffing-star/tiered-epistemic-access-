# Ecosystem Coordination & Collaboration Protocols  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the coordination mechanisms, collaboration protocols, and cross‑institution workflows that enable institutions to work together effectively within the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Coordination protocols ensure that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and public engagement remain aligned across diverse organizations.

These protocols support interoperability, shared stewardship, and ecosystem‑wide coherence.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑coordination‑and‑collaboration‑protocols directory provides:

- cross‑institution coordination models  
- collaboration workflows and communication channels  
- shared governance and decision‑making protocols  
- multi‑stakeholder alignment mechanisms  
- conflict resolution and escalation pathways  
- ecosystem‑wide synchronization tools  

These protocols ensure institutions operate as a unified, resilient ecosystem.
