# Risk Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines structured risk models that identify, categorize, and evaluate risks associated with layered epistemic access.  
Risk models help institutions anticipate failure modes, quantify exposure, and design mitigation strategies aligned with safety, governance, and certification requirements.

These models form the analytical backbone of risk‑aware deployment and oversight.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The risk‑models directory provides:

- formal risk taxonomies  
- threat modeling frameworks  
- likelihood and impact scoring models  
- mitigation strategies  
- cross‑layer risk analysis  
- governance‑aligned risk evaluation  

These models support proactive risk management across platforms, institutions, and regulatory environments.

## 🧩 Core Risk Model Categories

### **1. Layer‑Specific Risk Models**
Risks inherent to each epistemic layer:

- reasoning‑depth misalignment  
- unauthorized upward transitions  
- abstraction failures  
- sensitive content leakage  
- domain‑specific safety risks  

Each layer has unique exposure patterns.

---

### **2. Transition Risk Models**
Risks associated with moving between layers:

- upward transition bypass  
- downward migration failure  
- provenance discontinuity  
- safety filter bypass  
- incorrect refusal behavior  

Transitions are high‑risk zones requiring strict controls.

---

### **3. Adversarial Risk Models**
Risks from malicious or adversarial actors:

- prompt injection  
- reasoning‑boundary probing  
- certification spoofing  
- provenance tampering  
- cross‑platform attack vectors  

These models inform adversarial‑resilience requirements.

---

### **4. Provenance & Attestation Risk Models**
Risks related to provenance integrity:

- incomplete trace logging  
- tampered events  
- broken cross‑platform stitching  
- invalid or missing attestations  
- retention or export failures  

Provenance is a critical trust layer.

---

### **5. Licensing & Certification Risk Models**
Risks in human and model authorization:

- license misuse or fraud  
- expired or revoked licenses  
- uncertified model usage  
- certification drift  
- cross‑institution mismatch  

Authorization failures can cascade across layers.

---

### **6. Platform & Operational Risk Models**
Risks in platform‑level implementation:

- enforcement gaps  
- multi‑tenant isolation failures  
- monitoring blind spots  
- incident response delays  
- governance misalignment  

Operational risk is where theory meets reality.

---

### **7. Ecosystem & Interoperability Risk Models**
Risks across institutions and vendors:

- inconsistent safety enforcement  
- incompatible provenance formats  
- certification fragmentation  
- regulatory misalignment  
- cross‑platform attack propagation  

Interoperability introduces systemic risk.
