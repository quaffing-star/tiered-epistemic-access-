# Ecosystem Governance Charters  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory contains foundational governance charters that define the roles, responsibilities, authorities, and shared commitments of institutions participating in the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Governance charters serve as constitutional documents that anchor legitimacy, accountability, and long‑term stability across platforms, regulators, certification bodies, research institutions, and open‑source communities.

These charters ensure that the ecosystem operates with clarity, fairness, and durable governance principles.
