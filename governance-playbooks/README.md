# Governance Playbooks  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory provides practical, scenario‑driven governance playbooks that help institutions implement, operate, and oversee the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
While governance‑models/ defines the structural architecture, governance‑playbooks/ provides actionable guidance for real‑world decision‑making.

These playbooks are designed for licensing authorities, certification bodies, platform operators, compliance teams, and multi‑stakeholder governance groups.
