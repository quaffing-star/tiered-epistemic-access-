# Model Layer Definitions  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the epistemic layers that structure reasoning depth within the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
Each layer represents a distinct level of abstraction, capability, and risk, with corresponding licensing, certification, and provenance requirements.

These definitions form the backbone of the framework’s safety, governance, and implementation architecture.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The model‑layer‑definitions directory provides:

- formal definitions of each epistemic layer  
- capability boundaries  
- safety constraints  
- licensing requirements  
- certification criteria  
- provenance expectations  
- downward‑migration rules  

These definitions ensure consistent interpretation across research, governance, and implementation contexts.

## 🧩 Planned Layer Definitions

### **Layer 1 — Surface Reasoning**
- Basic pattern recognition  
- Generalized explanations  
- No sensitive or high‑risk content  
- Suitable for all users  
- Minimal provenance requirements  
- No licensing required  

### **Layer 2 — Structured Reasoning**
- Multi‑step logic  
- Domain‑aware explanations  
- Safe abstraction of complex ideas  
- Requires basic user competency  
- Certified models recommended  
- Provenance logs enabled  

### **Layer 3 — Expert Reasoning**
- Domain‑specific expertise  
- Advanced problem‑solving  
- Higher‑risk content potential  
- Requires intermediate licensing  
- Certified models required  
- Full provenance traceability  

### **Layer 4 — High‑Abstraction Reasoning**
- Cross‑domain synthesis  
- Complex causal modeling  
- Sensitive or high‑impact insights  
- Requires advanced licensing  
- Strict certification criteria  
- Downward‑migration required for public outputs  

### **Layer 5 — Adversarial‑Aware Reasoning**
- Detection of adversarial prompts  
- Counterfactual and red‑team reasoning  
- High‑risk content generation potential  
- Requires expert licensing  
- Highest certification tier  
- Mandatory provenance and audit trails  

### **Layer 6 — Meta‑Reasoning & Refinement**
- Reasoning about reasoning  
- Structural analysis of epistemic layers  
- Refinement engine for downward migration  
- Restricted to certified systems and expert users  
- Full provenance, attestation, and auditability  
- Outputs must be distilled before leaving the layer
