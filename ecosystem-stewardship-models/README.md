# Ecosystem Stewardship Models  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines stewardship models that guide the long‑term care, evolution, and sustainability of the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Stewardship ensures that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and interoperability remain healthy, adaptive, and aligned with public interest over time.

These models help institutions share responsibility for maintaining the ecosystem’s integrity and vitality.

## 🎯 Purpose

The ecosystem‑stewardship‑models directory provides:

- long‑term stewardship frameworks  
- shared maintenance responsibilities  
- ecosystem renewal and evolution models  
- cross‑institution stewardship agreements  
- sustainability and continuity strategies  
- public‑interest alignment mechanisms  

These models ensure the ecosystem remains resilient, adaptive, and trustworthy across generations of technology and governance.

## 🧩 Core Stewardship Model Categories

### **1. Shared Stewardship Model**
Defines how multiple institutions jointly steward the ecosystem:

- distributed governance responsibilities  
- shared maintenance cycles  
- cross‑institution renewal processes  
- stewardship rotation models  
- public accountability mechanisms  

### **2. Platform Stewardship Model**
Defines how platforms maintain compliance and integrity:

- ongoing certification alignment  
- safety and boundary maintenance  
- provenance and attestation upkeep  
- incident response stewardship  
- long‑term monitoring obligations  

### **3. Certification Stewardship Model**
Defines how certification bodies maintain standards:

- rubric evolution  
- evaluator training and renewal  
- recertification cycles  
- cross‑vendor alignment  
- public transparency commitments  

### **4. Licensing Stewardship Model**
Defines how licensing authorities maintain competency frameworks:

- competency model updates  
- license renewal and continuing education  
- appeals and remediation stewardship  
- cross‑institution reciprocity maintenance  
- public‑interest alignment  

### **5. Provenance & Attestation Stewardship Model**
Defines long‑term integrity maintenance:

- trace retention stewardship  
- attestation format evolution  
- cross‑platform stitching continuity  
- auditability preservation  
- tamper‑evidence guarantees  

### **6. Safety Stewardship Model**
Defines how safety evolves over time:

- safety constraint updates  
- adversarial‑resilience renewal  
- downward‑migration refinement  
- cross‑layer safety alignment  
- public safety reporting  

### **7. Ecosystem Evolution Model**
Defines how the entire ecosystem adapts:

- versioning and release cycles  
- amendment and evolution processes  
- multi‑stakeholder review cycles  
- public consultation mechanisms  
- long‑term roadmap governance
