# Project Roadmap  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This roadmap outlines the planned development trajectory for the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
It is organized into phases that reflect conceptual expansion, documentation growth, governance modeling, and eventual technical implementation.

The roadmap is iterative and will evolve as the project matures.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1 — Foundation (Completed / In Progress)

**Goal:** Establish the conceptual architecture and core documentation.

- Create top‑level README  
- Add one‑page summary  
- Add slide‑deck outline  
- Establish contribution guidelines  
- Add code of conduct  
- Create glossary and FAQ  
- Build core directory structure:
  - concept‑note  
  - curriculum‑framework  
  - model‑certification  
  - governance‑models  
  - provenance‑architecture  
  - implementation‑pathways  
  - developer‑tooling  
  - diagram‑set  

**Status:** Largely complete

## 🧭 Phase 2 — Deepening the Architecture (Upcoming)

**Goal:** Expand each major component into a more detailed, standards‑ready form.

Planned additions:

- **Concept Note Enhancements**
  - Add diagrams  
  - Add examples  
  - Add cross‑references to governance and provenance  

- **Curriculum Framework**
  - Competency maps  
  - Layer‑specific learning objectives  
  - Assessment models  

- **Model Certification**
  - Certification criteria  
  - Evaluation rubrics  
  - Certification pipeline diagrams  

- **Governance Models**
  - Hybrid governance blueprint  
  - Licensing authority model  
  - Certification body model  
  - Standards‑body integration  

- **Provenance Architecture**
  - Reasoning trace schema  
  - Downward‑migration provenance model  
  - Audit trail specification  
  - Attestation and verification mechanisms  

**Status:** In progress

## 🏗️ Phase 3 — Implementation Resources (Planned)

**Goal:** Provide practical tools and examples for developers and institutions.

Planned additions:

- **Developer Tooling**
  - Layer‑switching API sketches  
  - Developer filters and wrappers  
  - Debugging and trace utilities  
  - Downward‑migration test harness  

- **Implementation Pathways**
  - Regulatory integration examples  
  - Enterprise adoption models  
  - Academic research pathways  
  - Open‑source community integration  

- **Diagram Set**
  - Epistemic layer map  
  - Licensing flow  
  - Certification pipeline  
  - Provenance architecture  
  - Governance structure  
  - Implementation pathways overview  

**Status:** Planned

---

## 🏛️ Phase 4 — Standards & Interoperability (Future)

**Goal:** Align the framework with emerging standards and regulatory ecosystems.

Planned work:

- Map to existing AI safety standards  
- Define interoperability models  
- Create cross‑platform provenance exchange formats  
- Draft certification and licensing templates  
- Develop institutional adoption guidelines  

**Status:** Future phase

---

## 🌐 Phase 5 — Reference Implementations (Aspirational)

**Goal:** Provide minimal, illustrative implementations of key components.

Potential deliverables:

- Prototype layer‑switching interface  
- Example licensing check module  
- Mock certification registry  
- Sample provenance logger  
- Downward‑migration demonstration  

These are not production systems — they are reference examples to help others adopt the framework.

**Status:** Long‑term aspiration
