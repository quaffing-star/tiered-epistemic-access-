# Ethical Principles & Norms  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the ethical foundations, guiding principles, and normative commitments that shape the Tiered Epistemic Access ecosystem.  
Ethical principles ensure that governance, safety, certification, provenance, and public engagement remain aligned with human values, societal well‑being, and long‑term public interest.

These principles serve as the moral compass for all institutions participating in the ecosystem.
