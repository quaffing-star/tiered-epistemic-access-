# Slide Deck Outline  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This outline provides a structured, presentation‑ready flow for a 10–12 slide deck introducing the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework. It is designed for researchers, policymakers, standards bodies, and technical audiences.

## 1. Title Slide
- **Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**  
- A Licensing‑Based Architecture for Responsible AI Reasoning  
- Author(s), affiliation(s), date  
- Optional: logo or visual motif

---

## 2. The Problem Space
- AI systems operate with uneven reasoning depth  
- Users vary widely in competence and intent  
- No standardized way to align reasoning depth with user capability  
- Risks: misuse, overreach, hallucination, adversarial prompting, epistemic instability

---

## 3. Core Insight
- AI reasoning should be **layered**, not monolithic  
- Access to deeper reasoning should depend on:  
  - user competency  
  - model certification  
  - institutional oversight  
- This mirrors aviation, medicine, and amateur radio licensing

---

## 4. Epistemic Layers Overview
- Layered reasoning hierarchy  
- Increasing abstraction, complexity, and risk  
- Each layer has:  
  - capabilities  
  - constraints  
  - safety requirements  
  - certification thresholds  
- Visual diagram placeholder

---

## 5. Human Licensing
- Competency‑based access to deeper layers  
- Curriculum‑driven training  
- Assessments tied to epistemic discipline  
- Parallels: pilot licensing, medical boards, FCC amateur radio  
- Benefits: safety, accountability, transparency

---

## 6. Model Certification
- AI systems must be certified for layer‑specific operation  
- Certification evaluates:  
  - adversarial robustness  
  - provenance integrity  
  - downward‑migration safety  
  - alignment stability  
  - reasoning‑boundary discipline  
- Ensures models respect epistemic constraints

---

## 7. Downward Knowledge Migration
- Higher layers act as refinement engines  
- Distill complex or sensitive knowledge into safe, generalized forms  
- Enables responsible knowledge flow  
- Prevents leakage of unsafe or adversarial content  
- Diagram placeholder

---

## 8. Curriculum Framework
- Structured training for human licensing  
- Competency maps  
- Layer‑specific learning objectives  
- Assessment pathways  
- Integration with developer tools and platform enforcement

---

## 9. Implementation Pathways
- Regulatory integration  
- Platform‑level enforcement  
- Enterprise adoption  
- Academic research programs  
- Open‑source community tooling  
- Modular, incremental adoption

---

## 10. Governance & Oversight
- Licensing authorities  
- Certification bodies  
- Audit trails  
- Interpretability tools  
- Developer APIs  
- Institutional responsibilities  
- Ensures long‑term stability and accountability

---

## 11. Benefits & Impact
- Safer AI reasoning  
- Transparent epistemic boundaries  
- Reduced misuse and adversarial exploitation  
- Scalable governance  
- Harmonization across institutions and platforms  
- Supports responsible exploration and innovation

---

## 12. Closing Slide
- Summary of the framework  
- Call to collaboration  
- Contact information  
- Optional: link to repository or concept note
