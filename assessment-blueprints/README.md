# Assessment Blueprints  
**Tiered Epistemic Access Framework**

This directory defines the assessment structures used to determine human licensing levels within the Tiered Epistemic Access Framework.  
Assessments ensure that users demonstrate the epistemic discipline, safety awareness, and reasoning competence required to access deeper layers.

These blueprints provide the scaffolding for a rigorous, transparent, and scalable licensing system.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The assessment‑blueprints directory provides:

- layer‑specific assessment models  
- competency maps  
- evaluation rubrics  
- sample questions and tasks  
- safety‑critical scenario assessments  
- guidelines for licensing authorities  

These materials support consistent, fair, and evidence‑based licensing decisions.

## 🧩 Planned Assessment Categories

### **1. Layer 1 → Layer 2 Licensing Assessment**
Focus: foundational reasoning discipline  
Includes:

- basic logic tasks  
- safe abstraction exercises  
- provenance awareness checks  
- scenario‑based questions  

### **2. Layer 2 → Layer 3 Licensing Assessment**
Focus: domain‑aware reasoning  
Includes:

- multi‑step reasoning tasks  
- domain‑specific comprehension  
- safe generalization exercises  
- adversarial‑prompt awareness  

### **3. Layer 3 → Layer 4 Licensing Assessment**
Focus: advanced abstraction  
Includes:

- cross‑domain synthesis tasks  
- causal reasoning exercises  
- safety‑critical scenario analysis  
- downward‑migration demonstrations  

### **4. Layer 4 → Layer 5 Licensing Assessment**
Focus: adversarial‑aware reasoning  
Includes:

- red‑team prompt detection  
- reasoning‑boundary discipline  
- high‑risk content mitigation  
- provenance‑linked justification tasks  

### **5. Layer 5 → Layer 6 Licensing Assessment**
Focus: meta‑reasoning and refinement  
Includes:

- reasoning‑about‑reasoning tasks  
- structural analysis of epistemic layers  
- refinement engine demonstrations  
- migration‑safety evaluations

## 📚 Assessment Components

Each assessment blueprint will include:

- **Competency Objectives**  
  What the user must demonstrate.

- **Assessment Format**  
  Written, interactive, scenario‑based, or mixed.

- **Evaluation Rubric**  
  Criteria for passing, failing, or remediation.

- **Safety Requirements**  
  Layer‑specific safety expectations.

- **Provenance Expectations**  
  How reasoning traces should be documented.

- **Sample Tasks**  
  Illustrative questions or scenarios.

## 📂 Future Documents

Planned additions may include:

- **layer-1-to-2-assessment.md**  
- **layer-2-to-3-assessment.md**  
- **layer-3-to-4-assessment.md**  
- **layer-4-to-5-assessment.md**  
- **layer-5-to-6-assessment.md**  
- **assessment-rubric-template.md**  
- **competency-map-overview.md**  
- **scenario-based-assessment-guide.md**  

These documents will expand the directory into a full licensing assessment framework.
