- clarifying standards of acceptable behavior  
- reviewing contributions for conceptual, epistemic, and governance alignment  
- guiding discussions toward productive outcomes  
- moderating issues and pull requests when necessary  
- taking appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior

# 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- all contributions  
- issue discussions

- documentation updates  
- design proposals  
- governance discussions  
- project‑related communication in any channel  

The standards apply equally to contributors, maintainers, and external participants.

# 🧭 Epistemic Integrity & Provenance Expectations

Because this project centers on epistemic governance, contributors must:

- distinguish clearly between fact, interpretation, and speculation  
- avoid introducing unverifiable or unsafe reasoning patterns  
- maintain provenance and attestation for claims, diagrams, and models  
- avoid embedding hidden assumptions or unreviewed governance structures  
- ensure downward knowledge migration is handled responsibly  

Epistemic integrity is a core requirement, not an optional guideline.

---

# 🏛 Cross‑Institution Neutrality

To maintain fairness and global applicability:

- contributions must not promote specific institutions, companies, or political entities  
- governance proposals must remain institution‑agnostic  
- examples should be generic unless explicitly required for clarity  
- no contributor may use the project to advance organizational agendas  

This ensures the framework remains a shared public good.

---

# 🧩 Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises:

1. **Engage respectfully** with the other party.  
2. **Seek clarification** before assuming intent.  
3. **Consult maintainers** if the issue cannot be resolved collaboratively.  
4. Maintainers will:  
   - review the concern  
   - request additional context if needed  
   - propose a resolution  
   - take corrective action if necessary  

All conflicts will be handled with discretion, fairness, and respect.
